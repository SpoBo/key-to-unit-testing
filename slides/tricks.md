##  tricks

* `(describe|it).only` — runs just that describe or it block
* `x(describe|it)` — skip describe or it block
* `--watch` — automatically run when change in spec or dependency
* `sinon`
	* spies — just remember this one. stubs & mocks build on top of this
	* mock time
* rewire npm module — test smell if used. means dependencies are not passed to the service
* don't forget you can use v8debugger on mocha tests too
