##  BDD

##### Behaviour Driven Development

* write a spec first
* don't be afraid to split out smaller services if the spec makes no sense or seems to do too much
* thinking about dependencies, API, usability
* then write the logic
* see pre-written spec go from 100% ❌ to 100% ✅
* red to green verifies that spec actually reacts to implementation
