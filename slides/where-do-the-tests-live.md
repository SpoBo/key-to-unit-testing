##  Where Do The Tests Live?

* tests hidden away inside tests folder â€” nobody looks at those
* `*Spec.js` files next to the services they act on
* developers see it during development
* developers see a spec is missing. they should feel guilty!
* `*Spec.js` means a spec is written for a single service, resulting in better specs & codebase
