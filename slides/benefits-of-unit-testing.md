##  Benefits of Unit-Testing

* automatic assertion that code is still working
* don't lose time with manual testing
* ability to test all edgecases
    * even before they happen
    * easier setup of edgecases
* no dead code added
    * usually lines of code that do nothing are added when it takes a long time to test that code
* developer documentation
    * see how something is supposed to be used
    * see what the edgecases are supposed to be
